### ðŸŽ¯ The objective:
- In this project we will explore data from the Olympic Games, considering data from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016, using some libraries for Data Science and applying Machine Learning techniques to estimate some results based on history.

---
### ðŸ“Š The dataset:
- For this project we will use the dataset available on Kaggle, created by Randi H Griffin, PhD (https://www.randigriffin.com/), using www.sports-reference.com data as reference.
- You can check the dataset on https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results?select=athlete_events.csv,

### :trophy: The progress of the project:
- We started with the Exploratory Data Analysis, looking for duplicate and missing values, and founding some interesting insights into the history of Olympic Games during the period 1896-2016.
- On the next steps, let's dive deeper into the data and start the modeling phase.
