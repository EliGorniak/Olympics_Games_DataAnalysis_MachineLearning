</p>


---
### ðŸŽ¯ The objectiv:
- In this project we gonna explore the data of the Olympic Games, considering the data from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016, using some libraries for Data Science and apply Machine Learning Techniques to estimate some results based on the history.

---
### ðŸ“Š The dataset:
- For this project we gonna use the dataset available on Kaggle, created by Randi H Griffin, PhD (https://www.randigriffin.com/), using www.sports-reference.com data as reference.
- You can check the dataset on https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results?select=athlete_events.csv,

### :trophy: The progress of the project:
- We started with the Exploratory Data Analysis, looking for duplicate and missing values, and founding some interesting insights about the history of Olympic Games during the period of 1896 until 2016.
- On the next steps, we gonna go deeper on the data and start the modeling phase.
